# Power Host

An Among Us mod / BepInEx plugin which gives hosts more abilities.  
Note: Currently, mod resources are in Resources/powerhost, which is an
Asset Bundle. I plan to add the relevant Unity project to the repository
later, but I want to at least put the code in the repository for now.  
<sup>_(It's just ugly recolored vanilla sprites anyway...)_</sup>
